    <h1>About Us – Lerato Foundation</h1>
    <p>
      Lerato Foundation is a <strong>youth-led, student-centered, and community-driven organization</strong> 
      founded in <strong>November 2022</strong>. The foundation began its journey as 
      <em>Unawiri Children Foundation</em> before rebranding to Lerato Foundation to expand its vision 
      and deepen its reach in <strong>transforming lives, uplifting communities, and shaping future leaders</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are guided by the belief that meaningful change starts with <strong>students, youth, and communities</strong> 
      working together. Students are the seed of tomorrow’s leaders, youth bring innovation and energy, and communities 
      provide the foundation for growth. By bringing these three pillars together, Lerato Foundation drives change that is 
      holistic, sustainable, and impactful.
