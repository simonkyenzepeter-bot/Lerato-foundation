      <p>True transformation begins when communities come together, united by a shared vision of progress and dignity.</p>
      <p>On 23rd August 2025, we organized a community engagement forum where leaders, parents, and youth gathered to discuss the challenges and opportunities within our society. From education to health, from clean water to youth empowerment, every voice mattered.</p>
      <p>The discussions were lively, practical, and inspiring. What stood out most was the spirit of ownership ‚Äî community members realized that they are not just beneficiaries of programs but also active contributors to change.</p>
      <p>This forum planted seeds of collective responsibility, where every action, no matter how small, contributes to the bigger picture of growth. It was a reminder that sustainable development is not imposed from outside but built from within, with everyone playing their part.</p>

      </a>
      <p>Inspired by the heartbreaking reality of Bengo‚Äôs water crisis, the Lerato Foundation officially launched the Bengo Community Water Project on 19th August 2025. In partnership with a drilling company, the project began with a detailed geographical survey to determine the most suitable site for a borehole.</p>
      <p>This marked the community‚Äôs first real step toward lasting change. The survey was not just technical work ‚Äî it was the foundation of a dream to provide families with safe water at their doorstep.</p>
      <p>For Bengo, this launch was more than a project kickoff. It was the start of a brighter future where mothers would no longer trek miles for unsafe water, children could attend school without the burden of fetching water, and the entire community could look forward to healthier lives.</p>
      <p>The journey of hope has just begun, but already the people of Bengo walk with renewed courage, knowing that their story is changing.</p>

      </a>
      <p>On 29th July 2025, the Lerato Foundation team visited Bengo community for a water assessment. What we found was heartbreaking ‚Äî families walking more than 6.2 km each day to fetch water that was unsafe for human consumption. The only available source was a stagnant stream, muddy and contaminated, yet it remained the lifeline for hundreds of people.</p>
      <p>Seeing young children carrying heavy jerricans, and women spending countless hours on this daily task, was a painful reminder of the urgent need for intervention. Access to clean water is not just a matter of convenience ‚Äî it is a matter of survival, dignity, and health.</p>
      <p>That day, the Lerato team resolved to seek solutions that could bring safe, clean water closer to Bengo. It marked the beginning of a journey of hope, resilience, and determination.</p>

      <p>Sports are more than just games ‚Äî they are a powerful tool for uniting communities, building confidence, and inspiring young people to reach their full potential.</p>
      <p>In December 2024, we held a youth sports day that brought together young people from different schools and neighborhoods. With football, volleyball, and athletics, the event was filled with energy, teamwork, and a spirit of friendship.</p>
      <p>The initiative wasn‚Äôt just about competition, but about mentorship. Coaches and mentors shared lessons on discipline, resilience, and leadership ‚Äî values that sports naturally instill. For many youth, this was a rare opportunity to showcase their talents and realize that they can excel both on and off the field.</p>
      <p>Through sports, we continue to raise a generation that is not only physically strong but also morally grounded and socially responsible.</p>

      </a>
      <p>On 19th May 2024, we had the honor of hosting Martha Sales, a Christian missionary and mentor whose passion for serving communities is both inspiring and practical. Her visit was part of the Life Program, an initiative she has been nurturing to equip people with skills that go beyond academics ‚Äî focusing on leadership, service, and personal growth.</p>
      <p>During her visit, Martha facilitated life skills training sessions, instilling Christian values of humility, compassion, and integrity. She emphasized that true leadership begins with serving others, just as Christ Himself demonstrated. She reminded us that when leaders step forward with faith, dedication, and love, they empower whole communities to rise together.</p>
      <p>The sessions were not only interactive and practical but also deeply spiritual, encouraging young people to root their lives in faith while pursuing excellence in service. Martha‚Äôs message was clear: we are called to be agents of transformation, shining as examples of hope in our schools, homes, and neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Her visit left a lasting impact ‚Äî planting seeds of courage, responsibility, and faith. For many, it was a turning point; a reminder that every act of service is also an act of worship, and that true change begins with the willingness to lead by example in Christ.</p>
